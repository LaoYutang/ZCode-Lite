ZCode-Lite is an AI coding workspace with desktop, browser, and terminal interfaces. This repository contains the clients, backend services, shared UI, and Agent CLI and runtime source code.

## Fork notice

This repository is a fork of [zai-org/ZCode](https://github.com/zai-org/ZCode), renamed to **ZCode-Lite**. It keeps the ZCode coding workspace while dropping the dependency on Zhipu's (Z.ai / BigModel) account system, maintained as a lightweight, self-hostable branch.

Main differences from upstream:

- **Login and account interfaces removed**: Z.ai / BigModel OAuth login, browser authorization and deep link callbacks, Coding Plan API Key exchange, account credential refresh, and the account-state derivation built on them. The app holds no login state and exposes no login entry point.
- **Account-derived official features removed**: off-peak tasks, plan subscription and quota panel, plan identity badges, official Server MCP credentials, telemetry identity and marketing attribution, and remote workspace credential delivery.
- **Official help, feedback, and sharing entry points removed**: the help menu keeps only Resource Manager, Check for Updates, and About; product docs / community / issue reporting / feature requests, conversation sharing (including the share deep link and the Web share landing page), and the built-in feedback center are gone, and no remote help config is fetched.
  - **Fully self-managed providers**: the built-in config only supplies `api-key` templates and generic model metadata; the user's personal provider config (default `~/.zcode/v2/provider_config.json`) is the single source of truth.
  - **Desktop update source decoupled**: the official manifest is no longer requested; updates read this repository's GitHub Releases and only notify with a link to the download page, never downloading or installing automatically.

The display name (window titles, About, installer and Release names) is **ZCode-Lite**; identifiers such as the `zcode` command, the `@zcode/*` package scope, the deep link scheme, and the Linux package names stay aligned with upstream so the fork can keep following it. See [specs/build/product-identity.md](specs/build/product-identity.md), [specs/provider/account-free-providers.md](specs/provider/account-free-providers.md), [specs/help/client-help-surfaces.md](specs/help/client-help-surfaces.md), and [specs/update/desktop-auto-update-source.md](specs/update/desktop-auto-update-source.md) for the full rules.

## Interfaces

| Interface                         | Purpose                                                                                   | Development command            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Desktop                           | Electron desktop application                                                              | `pnpm dev:desktop`             |
| Web / ZCode-Lite CLI distribution | Terminal and browser workspace; packages the TUI, Web client, backend, and Agent together | `pnpm dev:web`                 |
| Agent CLI                         | The `zcode` terminal interface, which also provides the Agent runtime for Desktop and Web | `pnpm --filter @zcode/cli dev` |

## Setup

Install Git, Node.js **24.14.0**, and pnpm **10.33.2**. [mise.toml](mise.toml) is the source of truth for tool versions. Run all development and packaging commands below from the repository root.

```bash
pnpm bootstrap
```

`pnpm bootstrap` installs workspace dependencies, prepares local desktop runtime assets, and runs `build:bootstrap`.

The Agent CLI and runtime source code lives in [apps/zcode-cli/](apps/zcode-cli/) as a regular directory included when you clone this repository. No separate checkout or Git submodule initialization is required.

Additional setup and build commands:

| Command                        | Purpose                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`                 | Install dependencies                                                                                                                |
| `pnpm prepare:desktop-runtime` | Prepare desktop runtime assets, including remote assets by default                                                                  |
| `pnpm prepare:remote-assets`   | Prepare remote runtime assets separately                                                                                            |
| `pnpm bootstrap:with-remote`   | Set up dependencies and local and remote assets, then build the relevant packages sequentially; skip the desktop application bundle |
| `pnpm build`                   | Recursively run each workspace package's build script, including its asset preparation steps                                        |

The default `bootstrap` skips remote asset preparation and is suitable for local desktop development. Run the corresponding preparation command when working with remote workspaces or validating remote distribution assets.

## Development and Usage

### Desktop

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop

# Use the test environment
pnpm dev:desktop:test
```

`pnpm dev:desktop` defaults to `pnpm dev:desktop:prod` and uses production service configuration. The startup script prepares local runtime assets, builds the desktop Agent, then starts Electron and source watchers.

Set `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR` to use a separate development data directory. For example, on macOS / Linux:

```bash
ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR="$HOME/.zcode-dev-home" pnpm dev:desktop:test
```

### Remote features (SSH/WSL)

Run `pnpm bootstrap:with-remote` to prepare the remote assets (mock-cdn) first, then `pnpm dev:desktop`; when connecting to a remote project, choose "Download locally then upload" for the assets. In development, assets come from the local `packages/desktop/mock-cdn` and local build outputs, are uploaded to the remote host over SFTP, and never come from a CDN.

If no SSH host is at hand, the Dockerfile in [harness/remote](harness/remote/) starts a test container locally.

### Web Development

Use development mode when editing Web or backend source code:

```bash
pnpm dev:web

# Set the backend workspace (macOS / Linux)
ZCODE_SERVER_WORKSPACE=/path/to/project pnpm dev:web
```

This starts both the Web development server (default: `http://localhost:5173`) and the backend (default: `http://localhost:3030`). Open the Web development server in your browser. `/ws` and general `/api` requests are proxied to the local backend; `/api/v1/oauth/token` is proxied separately to the configured product service.

After changing Agent source code, run `pnpm --filter @zcode/cli... build` and restart the service. To validate the complete distribution, extract and run it as described under Packaging → ZCode-Lite CLI distribution below.

### ZCode-Lite CLI distribution

The command-line distribution includes the TUI, Web client, and Agent behind one `zcode` command. With no arguments it starts the TUI; a leading `--web` starts Web mode; all other arguments go to the existing Agent CLI. Both modes run locally without Electron.

```bash
# Start the terminal UI by default
zcode

# Start the Web interface
zcode --web

# Set the project and port without opening a browser automatically
zcode --web --workspace /path/to/project --port 3030 --no-open

# Show CLI or Web options
zcode --help
zcode --web --help
```

In Web mode, it uses the current directory as the workspace, listens on `127.0.0.1` without token authentication by default, selects an available port, and opens a browser. Use the URL printed in the terminal and press `Ctrl+C` to stop the service. For LAN access, use `--host 0.0.0.0`; listening on a non-local address generates an access token by default. Use the token-bearing URL printed in the terminal. Set a token with `--token`, or disable token authentication with `--no-token`.

When starting the general Web service's HTTP entry directly, configure API/WebSocket authentication with `ZCODE_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`. When creating the service programmatically, use the `authToken` option.

See Packaging below for build instructions. `pnpm build:zcode` only creates the distribution; it does not replace an existing `zcode` on `PATH`. If the command still points to an older installation or another checkout, check it with `command -v zcode` on macOS / Linux or `where.exe zcode` on Windows.

### CLI Source Development

Use the source entry when developing the TUI or Agent:

```bash
pnpm --filter @zcode/cli dev --help
pnpm --filter @zcode/cli dev

# Build the CLI and its workspace dependencies
pnpm --filter @zcode/cli... build
node apps/zcode-cli/packages/cli/dist/zcode.cjs --help
```

This entry runs the Agent CLI directly and does not handle the distribution's `--web` switch. Use `pnpm dev:web` for Web development, or the extracted `bin/zcode.mjs` shown below to test the unified command.

## Configuration

The root [.env.example](.env.example) provides sample service URLs and build configuration. Copy it to `.env` as needed and place local overrides in `.env.local`. Select the Desktop development environment with `dev:desktop:test` or `dev:desktop:prod`.

| Setting                              | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR`                | Base directory for application data, stored under its `.zcode/` subdirectory            |
| `ZCODE_SERVER_WORKSPACE`             | Workspace path for the Web backend                                                      |
| `ZCODE_BUILTIN_PROVIDER_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to a local provider configuration file; uses the built-in configuration when unset |
| `ZCODE_DIST_BASE_URL`                | Download base URL used by the CLI distribution installer                                |

Runtime variables can be set explicitly in the environment of the startup command. The built-in provider configuration ships under `config/provider/`.

## Packaging

Third-party notices and license materials: `node scripts/licenses.mjs notices` regenerates [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md); versions and sources are recorded in `third-party/inventory.json`, and `node scripts/licenses.mjs check --strict` is the pre-release gate.

### Desktop

```bash
pnpm bundle:desktop

# Set the target platform and CPU architecture
pnpm bundle:desktop -- --os win --arch x64

pnpm bundle:desktop -- --help
```

The default target is macOS arm64, and the default output directory is `packages/desktop/dist/`. `--os` accepts `mac`, `win`, or `linux`; `--arch` accepts `x64` or `arm64`. Packaging and signing require the tools and configuration for the target platform.

Installation: open the DMG and drag ZCode-Lite into "Applications". Local builds are unsigned; if macOS blocks the first launch, run:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ZCode-Lite.app
```

### ZCode-Lite CLI distribution

Run `pnpm build:zcode` to build the CLI/TUI, backend, and Web client, collect the TUI native libraries, workers, and runtime dependencies, then assemble the distribution. Running the distribution still requires Node.js; use the version specified in `mise.toml`.

Before packaging, set the download base URL with `ZCODE_DIST_BASE_URL` in `.env`, `.env.local`, or the process environment, or pass it through `--base-url`. The URL below is a placeholder; replace it with your hosting URL when publishing:

```bash
pnpm build:zcode --base-url https://downloads.example.com/zcode/

# When ZCODE_DIST_BASE_URL is already configured
pnpm build:zcode

# Repackage existing Agent, backend, and Web build outputs
pnpm build:zcode --skip-build

# Show options for the version, output directory, and more
pnpm build:zcode --help
```

The version defaults to the root `package.json` version. Output is written to `dist/zcode/`:

- `releases/<version>/zcode-<version>.tar.gz`: runtime package.
- `releases/<version>/sha256.txt`: checksum file.
- `latest.json` and `install.sh`: version index and installer.

Upload the entire directory to the configured download base URL. The installer downloads the runtime package from that URL, installs it to `~/.zcode/runtime` by default, and creates the `zcode` command in `~/.local/bin`. Override these directories with `ZCODE_DIST_HOME` and `ZCODE_DIST_BIN_DIR`, respectively.

Existing Lite users should switch to the new build command, environment variables, and installer. Installation does not remove old Lite directories or migrate/delete session data.

To test a packaged build locally, extract and run it directly without uploading or installing it:

```bash
zcode_version=$(node -p "require('./dist/zcode/latest.json').version")
mkdir -p dist/zcode/debug
tar -xzf "dist/zcode/releases/$zcode_version/zcode-$zcode_version.tar.gz" \
  -C dist/zcode/debug
# Start the TUI by default
node dist/zcode/debug/zcode/bin/zcode.mjs

# Start Web mode
node dist/zcode/debug/zcode/bin/zcode.mjs --web \
  --workspace "$PWD" --port 3030 --no-open
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3030` to validate the complete flow, with one backend serving the Web pages and running the Agent. The port must be available; if `pnpm dev:web` is already running, choose another `--port`.
